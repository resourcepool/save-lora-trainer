# About Us

## The Dev Team

Loïc, Antoine and François have been working together for a few years at Takima.
Although they work on different topics on a daily basis, they all like driving themselves beyond their comfort zone.  

Most developers are good at web programming, and we get better at doing large-scale architectures every day.
Thanks to technology, we are adding layers of abstraction that allows us to develop faster.

The tradeoffs of this is that people get disconnected from the low-level universe.

It is very common to see websites with huge JS payloads, and it is sad to see how bad developers handle bandwidth.

We wanted through this workshop to reconnect you with this world.

## The Sponsors

Takima has been supporting us and gave us company time to work on this project.
They also provided support and coaching for the content itself and speaker-preparation.

It is an awesome company, you should [look it up](https://www.takima.fr) and try to join us :)
